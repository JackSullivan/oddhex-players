While traveling in the wilds, days are divided into six four-hour watches:

- Midnight-4am
- 4am-8am
- 8am-Noon
- Noon-4pm
- 4pm-8pm
- 8pm-Midnight

Most major actions (traveling, foraging, searching, etc.) take one watch to complete.

## Resolving Travel

The players declare their intention to head in a direction or in the supposed direction of a place that they have heard
of but not yet visited. Behind the screen, the GM resolves the rules for travel and describes what the players encounter
in the game world, referencing landmarks that players pass by but not explicitly referencing which hex they are in. The
players may be mistaken about what hex they're in just as they may be mistaken about the shapes and arrangement of rooms
in a dungeon they are mapping. 

If the players are heading to a place or landmark they have visited multiple times before, they are very unlikely to
require navigation checks or get lost except in the most dire of circumstances.

In order to heal your HP (not wounds) at the start of the day, players must sleep for two watches and have eaten a meal
the previous day. Retainers typically expect to be paid in advance for the expected duration of the expedition or,
failing that, each morning. They will desert with whatever they can make off with if not fed.

### Pressing Hard

Behind the screen, the GM rolls a d6 each watch to see what 'travel hazard' occurs. One of the travel hazards is 'fatigue' where the party must spend the next watch resting or else take one damage. Unless the party declares that they are 'pressing hard', the GM will automatically narrate such that they take the rest option. Likewise, they will narrate making camp for the day after the party has spent three watches that day in travel (see [travel speed](#travel-speed).

## Travel Roles

### Navigator

The navigator's Wisdom score is used to make [navigation](#navigation) checks. A navigator's assistant can be used to grant advantage on the checks.

### Lookout

The lookout's Wisdom score is used to detect threats and determine surprise in the event of a wilderness encounter.

### Tracker

The tracker's Wisdom score is used to find or follow tracks or paths through the wilderness.

## Travel Speed

PCs can move one six-mile hex per watch, up to three times per day. Each watch they travel after the third deals 1
direct damage to each PC unless they succeed at a CON check. Speed is halved in darkness, difficult terrain, or severe
weather and doubled when riding.

## Navigation

When travelling in unknown terrain, heavy weather, or other difficult circumstances, the GM uses the [navigator's](#navigator) Wisdom score to determine if they move to a random adjacent hex rather than the one the party intended to reach.

## Exploring

The party can spend a watch exploring the area of a six-mile hex to reveal any areas of interest (such as an overgrown
ruin, hidden pool, etc.) that wouldnâ€™t be noticed by passing through.

Secret features (such as buried treasure or a hidden door into a mountain) will have corresponding clues revealed by
exploring the hex, but can only be found by the PCs interacting with the game world.

## Foraging

Finding food takes a watch and requires passing a Wisdom check, with modifiers for weather, terrain, etc. On a success,
the party collects d6 rations.
