# Downtime Procedures

(Stolen liberally from [On Downtime and Demesnes](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/297829/On-Downtime-and-Demesnes-Basic-DD)) The content is largely the same, though I have tweaked some numbers. Object if you think it's unreasonable.

## Orgies Inc.

How to deal with your excess coin

### Adornment

Characters may deck themselves out in fashionable duds to gain status or experience. They do this by going shopping and
buying fancy clothes. They may exchange a maximum of 200ƒ for 100 experience by purchasing fancy pants and other
adornments.

A character cannot spend over 50ƒ a day and must locate a store that sells high quality clothes, shoes, or jewelry. If
they don't know such a store they can use the navigation procedure to locate one. After spending 200ƒ and 4 days the
character cannot use adornment further to gain experience until she returns from another adventure.

### Carousing

Characters can trade cash for experience. They roll 1d8 and multiply it by 100. That is the amount of gold spent in one
week. The character engages in one of several activities. 

- **Philanthropy:** Characters spend gold on a worthy social group. At the end of the week make a Wisdom save. 
- **Drinking/Orgies:** Characters spend gold on vice and excess. At the end of the week make a Constitution save. 
- **Study/Research:** Characters spend gold seeking ancient or forgotten lore. At the end of the week make an
  Intelligence save. 
- **Gourmandising:** Characters spend gold seeking new things to eat, consume, or experience. At the end of the week
  make a Charisma save.

If characters lack the funds, they gain 1/2 the experience points indicated by the die roll and spend all their funds.
The save has a penalty of -4 in this case.

On a failed save something interesting has happened. We'll roll on a random table to see just what that is. At the end
of the week, unless contradicted by a failed result, characters gain experience equal to coin spent.

### Rumors

Spend 1d4*10 gp and make a reaction roll (2d6+CHA). Takes one full day per attempt.

| Roll | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 2 | Failure, lose another 1d6×10 gp tracking a lead |
| 3-5 | Spend another 1d4x10 gp to hear one rumor |
| 6-8 | Hear one rumor |
| 7-11 | Spend another 2d10 gp to hear an extra rumor |
| 12+ | Hear two rumors |

### Healing

Each day spent in a safe haven (i.e. in a town) doing nothing but resting recovers one slot.

### Relaxation

After being at full health, characters may simply spend their time relaxing. If a week is spent resting, they get +1
hitpoint per level on their next adventure.

### Rodomontade
If the entire party (i.e. everyone who was on the adventure) spends a week after their adventure bragging about their
shenanigans, singing songs, telling stories, engaging in self- aggrandizement, and spreading the tale of their deeds of
derring-do, they gain an additional 5% experience from the previous adventure. A Charisma check (with appropriate
narrative motivation) may increase this bonus to +10%. No other activities may be performed during this time.

### Career Training

To gain a new career, a PC must find an expert in the field they wish to study and spend the required time and money.
Gaining a career gives PCs career-related knowledge, the ability to attempt related tasks and a +5 on related non-combat
checks. Careers differ in how difficult they are to master.

- **Common:** Requires 1 month and 1000gp (carpenter, hunter, fisherman, sailor, dyer, gardener, blacksmith, etc.).
- **Uncommon:** Requires 3 months and 5000gp to attempt related tasks and an additional 3 months and 5000gp to gain a +5
  to related non-combat checks (burglar, acrobat, locksmith, grave robber, herbalist, tattooist, prospector, etc.).
- **Rare:**  Requires 1 year and 30,000gp to attempt related tasks and an additional year and 30,000gp to gain a +5 to
  related non-combat checks (alchemist, lawyer, assassin, sculptor, folklorist, etc.).
