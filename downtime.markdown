# Downtime Procedures

(Stolen liberally from [On Downtime and
Demesnes](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/297829/On-Downtime-and-Demesnes-Basic-DD)) The content is largely
the same, though I have tweaked some numbers and harmonized it with Knave. Object where you think it's unreasonable.

## Lifestyles of the Rash and the Foolish

The character is required to provide upkeep for those in their employ, as well as themselves. This is the foundation of
all other downtime systems. As time passes, money is owed. This constant drain is the limitation that prevents endlessly
engaging in downtime. The lifestyle costs below _do not_ include lodging, which must be paid separately unless a
character owns or leases property in town.

| Lifestyle | Daily Cost | Live like a | Effects |
|-----------|-----------:|-------------|---------|
| Destitute | 3gp | Beggar, Outlaw | -1 hp/level -2 all saves, -1 morale for all hirelings |
| Poor | 10gp | Servant, Laborer, Farmer, Soldier | None |
| Humble | 20gp | Innkeeper, Craftsman, Mercenary | +1 all saves, +1 morale for all hirelings |
| Respectable | 40gp | Physician, Merchant, Master Craftsman | Permitted to build/buy real estate in towns |  
| Wealthy | 100gp | Knight, Courtier, Country Gentry | Permitted to clear territory/build holdings |
| Minor Noble | 400gp | Baron, Count | Permitted to hold a title and lead bands of 50-200 soldiers |
| Major Noble | 2000gp | Duke, Prince | Permitted to lead bands of any size and rule multiple holdings |
| Royal | 20,000gp | King, Emperor | Permitted to do whatever is in your power |

## Orgies, Inc.

How to deal with your excess coin.

### Adornment

Characters may deck themselves out in fashionable duds to gain status or experience. They do this by going shopping and
buying fancy clothes. They may exchange a maximum of 200ƒ for 100 experience by purchasing fancy pants and other
adornments.

A character cannot spend over 50ƒ a day and must locate a store that sells high quality clothes, shoes, or jewelry. If
they don't know such a store they can use the navigation procedure to locate one. After spending 200ƒ and 4 days the
character cannot use adornment further to gain experience until she returns from another adventure.

### Carousing

Characters can trade cash for experience. They roll 1d8×100. That is the amount of gold spent in one
week. The character engages in one of several activities. 

- **Philanthropy:** Characters spend gold on a worthy social group. At the end of the week make a Wisdom save. 
- **Drinking/Orgies:** Characters spend gold on vice and excess. At the end of the week make a Constitution save. 
- **Study/Research:** Characters spend gold seeking ancient or forgotten lore. At the end of the week make an
  Intelligence save. 
- **Gourmandising:** Characters spend gold seeking new things to eat, consume, or experience. At the end of the week
  make a Charisma save.

If characters lack the funds, they gain ½ the experience points indicated by the die roll and spend all their funds.
The save has a penalty of -4 in this case.

On a failed save something interesting has happened. We'll roll on a random table to see just what that is. At the end
of the week, unless contradicted by a failed result, characters gain experience equal to coin spent.

### Rodomontade
If the entire party (i.e. everyone who was on the adventure) spends a week after their adventure bragging about their
shenanigans, singing songs, telling stories, engaging in self-aggrandizement, and spreading the tale of their deeds of
derring-do, they gain an additional 5% experience from the previous adventure. A Charisma check (with appropriate
narrative motivation) may increase this bonus to +10%. No other activities may be performed during this time.

### Selling Loot

Alas, treasure is often rather bulky, and if characters were able to liberate it from a dungeon, thieves, tax
collectors, peasant mobs etc. may well be able to liberate it from then back it town. Best to turn it to something
useful quick.

The character looking to sell items makes a Charisma check. The size of the city and rarity of the items will modify the
roll. 

The amount of time it takes to find a buyer varies on the value of the item. An item worth tens of gp takes 1d4 days.
Hundreds of gp takes 1d6 days. Thousands of gp takes 1d10 days; tens of thousands of gp takes 2d8 days. Hundreds of
thousands of gold gp 3d12 days. Buyers don't necessarily (or typically) offer the full list price for treasure.

## Restore and Grow

### Healing

Each day spent in a safe haven (i.e. in a town) doing nothing but resting recovers one slot.

### Relaxation

After being at full health, characters may simply spend their time relaxing. If a week is spent resting, they get +1
hitpoint per level on their next adventure.

### Rumors

Spend 1d4×10 gp and make a reaction roll (2d6+CHA). Takes one full day per attempt.

| Roll | Effect |
|-----:|--------|
| 2 | Failure, lose another 1d6×10 gp tracking a lead |
| 3-5 | Spend another 1d4×10 gp to hear one rumor |
| 6-8 | Hear one rumor |
| 7-11 | Spend another 2d10 gp to hear an extra rumor |
| 12+ | Hear two rumors |

### Career Training

To gain a new career, a PC must find an expert in the field they wish to study and spend the required time and money.
Gaining a career gives PCs career-related knowledge, the ability to attempt related tasks and a +5 on related non-combat
checks. Careers differ in how difficult they are to master.

- **Common:** Requires 1 month and 1000gp (carpenter, hunter, fisherman, sailor, dyer, gardener, blacksmith, etc.).
- **Uncommon:** Requires 3 months and 5000gp to attempt related tasks and an additional 3 months and 5000gp to gain a +5
  to related non-combat checks (burglar, acrobat, locksmith, grave robber, herbalist, tattooist, prospector, etc.).
- **Rare:**  Requires 1 year and 30,000gp to attempt related tasks and an additional year and 30,000gp to gain a +5 to
  related non-combat checks (alchemist, lawyer, assassin, sculptor, folklorist, etc.).

## Make and Mend

### Alchemy

#### Brewing

Brewing a potion requires a fire, a cauldron, ingredients, and four hours (one watch) of time. The player describes the
effect and duration of the potion they are trying to make, along with the ingredients to be used (usually monster parts,
but in theory any rare substances with the right properties could be used). If the GM approves the effect, the PC makes
an INT check. The PC adds +5 to the check if they spend an additional watch brewing, and may add additional bonuses with
appropriate complementary ingredients. On a success, the potion is created. The parts are lost no matter the outcome. If
the PC succeeds at the check by 10 or more, they have created a recipe for that potion and no longer need to make a
brewing check to make it when using those exact ingredients.

#### Harvesting

Magical plants can be used for potions, but they usually grow in dangerous or lost locations. Most potions are made from
the organs of monsters that give them their special abilities, such as a dragon's lung (fire breathing) or a dragon's
scales (fireproofing). Harvesting a monster part requires one 10-minute turn and the proper tools. Harvested body parts
or plants take up at least one slot, due to the packaging and fluids they must be preserved in.

### Magical Research

#### Creating an Arcane Library

An arcane library is a collection of books, scrolls, and rare tomes that serve as a reference to opaque and cryptic
truths. It is used in creating magical and alchemical items, researching new spells, and creating constructs and
crossbreeds. In order to possess an arcane library, 800 square feet of space is needed. A scribe must be hired full time
to attend the library and keep it in good condition. If no scribe is hired, the library loses value over time as
references are lost or destroyed. In order to research new spells, characters need an arcane library equal to 10,000 gp
times the level of the spell or the research costs are doubled.

Assembling the library itself takes time - in a city one can spend 1,000gp/10,000 residents of the city/week to acquire
the necessary texts, outside of a city charaters must acquire [rumors](#rumors) for leads on likely tomes.

#### Researching new Spells

Spellbooks, or any other thing that allows someone to cast spells, cannot be bought with money.

However, with a sufficient [arcane library](#creating-an-arcane-library) and time, one can find leads on where spellbooks, or other beings or items
that can grant magical power can be found and how they can be induced to lend their power. Doing so costs 2,000gp and
two weeks per spell level to research.

#### Creating Magic items

Characters whose Intelligence + Wisdom equal at least 5 and whose level equals at least 5 may create magic items.

In order to craft magical or alchemical items, characters must first have a formula. Characters may acquire a formula
automatically by breaking down an existing item, or by researching. Researching an uncommon item formula costs 100 gp a
week, a rare item formula costs 500 gp per week, and a very rare item formula costs 1,000 gp per week. This requires 1d8
weeks of research, -1 if the characters Intelligence is at least 4 or -2 weeks if the character's Intelligence is at
least 6, and -1 for an [arcane library](#creating-an-arcane-library) greater than 50,000 gp. Research always takes a
minimum of one week.

The formula will inform the player how much gold, and how many rare materials the character will need in order to craft
the item. An alchemical item takes 1 day to craft per 50 gold pieces of its cost. A magical item takes 1 day to craft
for every 500 gold pieces of its cost.

Alchemical and magic items require a successful ability check to craft. Magic items also require a skilled crafter to
create the item. On a failure it requires the expenditure of time again; on a critical failure the materials are ruined.

### Practicing a Profession

Characters can choose to practice a craft or a profession in a city. This negates their living expenses and earns them
an appropriate salary in gold pieces per month. A character must have a relevant career to practice a profession, and
must do so in chunks of no less than 1 month (30 days). Pay depends on the nature of the profession, and is agreed upon
in advance with the GM.

### Investments and Mercantile Ventures

The character spends a week looking for an investment opportunity. This could be a property, a trade caravan or similar,
with the specifics determined by the Dungeon Master and the player together. The investment is either stable, risky, or
volatile. Stable investments have a 1d6-2% net return. Risky investments provide a 1d20-11% net return. Volatile
investments have a 50-1d100% net return. E.g. if characters invest 1,000 gp in a stable investment, and roll a 4, they
get a 2% net return (20 gp). The character receives a payout yearly and can withdraw investment money then. Withdrawal
outside this yearly period carries stiff penalties (between 10-20%). Adventuring can affect these return rates by
securing the investment. A successful adventure comparable to the risk of the investment can grant the maximum return.

### Sacrifice

The character can sacrifice gold or creatures to a dark master (if they have one). The character must have a specific
dark god to make a sacrifice in service of.

The blood of an animal counts as 100 gp.

The blood of a sentient counts as 1,000 gp per hit die.

This is doubled if a child (less than 19 years of age or whatever pre-adult is for the creature), doubled if a female,
doubled if willing, and doubled if a virgin.

On a successful Charisma check the dark master has accepted the character's sacrifice and rewards the character with the
gold value of the sacrifice. The gold can appear directly in front of the character or be given as a windfall. For every
1,000 gp value of the sacrifice, the Charisma check gains a +1 bonus.

Instead of receiving this gold, it can be exchanged 1:1 for experience, 1:2 for the acquisition of a magic item, or the
services of a demonic, devilish, undead, or dire creature for the length of 1 year and 1 day. The creature(s) can have
one hit die for each 1,000 gp spent.

On a failure the sacrifice is unsatisfactory and nothing happens.

All multipliers are cumulative. So a willing, young, virgin, human female would grant 16,000 experience, a magic item
worth 32,000 gp, or the services of a creature of up to 16 HD. This can be attempted only once per month on the
appropriately (un)holy day, usually the night of the new or full moon. Multiple creatures can be sacrificed. Sacrificing
gold or gold equivalent, returns the same benefits.

## Leave a Legacy

### Acquire Congregants/Faction Members

Characters who are member of a religion or faction where it makes sense can recruit congregants by performing charitable
deeds, sending out missionaries, casting spells charitably on peasants, and constructing shrines and temples. For every
1,000 gp spent a month doing these activities, 2d10 followers + 1 per Charisma join the character's
religion.

If a month passes and no action is taken to gain new followers and characters do not spend at least 1 week ministering
to their current congregation, then they will lose 1d4 followers.

Why would characters acquire followers? Each follower provides spiritual energy equal to their hit dice in gold pieces
per month for any magical or construction activity the character engages in. This lowers the cost of crafting items, or
researching new spells. It can also lower the cost of any construction projects relevant to the cause characters take on
in the interim, because the character's loyal followers work and donate their time without recompenses.

### Real Estate and Construction

#### Buying Buildings

The following costs are approximate and can be affected by a building’s condition, importance, size, etc. Players can
estimate the cost of custom buildings by summing the costs of several buildings that could make it up.

Note that money may not be sufficient to buy a building - it must be for sale, and the characters' social standing in
town should be such that people would find it acceptable. Increasing one's
[lifestyle](#lifestyles-of-the-rash-and-the-foolish) (and bribing townsfolk) go a long way in this regard.

| Building | Cost |
|----------|-----:|
| Poor hovel | 100 |
| Humble Cottage | 1k |
| Respectable house, chapel | 10k |
| Wealthy house, guildhall, theater, warehouse | 50k |
| Church, stone tower | 100k |
| Small castle | 2m |
| Minor noble's mansion, temple, medium castle | 8m |
| Large castle | 32m |
| Major noble's estate, cathedral | 100m |
| Imperial palace, basilica | 400m |

#### Construction

The table below lists the cost to build a 5’ square of a building in various levels of luxury and using different
materials. Ceilings are assumed to be 10 feet. Staffing a (non-business) building costs 50% of its cost per year.

Note that, before a building can be built, the land on which it is to be built must be owned by the character.

| Room Style | Cost |
|------------|-----:|
| **Poor** Mud walls, thatched roof, dirt floors | 10 |
| **Humble** Wattle and daub walls, with some brick or fieldstone, thatched roofs, reed floors | 50 |
| **Respectable** Wood or brick walls,  shingled roof, wood floors | 250 |
| **Wealthy** Mostly stone walls with wood and brick ornamentation, shngled roof, wood floors. Also the cost for 5' cube of defensive stone wall | 1,000 |
| **Minor Nobles and Castles** Stone walls, flagstone floors, some glass and marble, architectural flourish | 5,000 |
| **Major Nobles** Stone walls & roof, tiled floors, glass windows, high ceilings, truly artistic design | 50,000 |
| **Royal** Marble walls, stone roof, marble floors, glass windows, a sublime work that will become a biword for taste and luxury | 100,000 |

### Protégés and Inheritance

Characters can spend gold, up to their experience point total, to create an experience point pool that future player
characters can draw from after the character's unfortunate sudden but inevitable demise. This is gold spent in town by
creating training centers, giving speeches at local fairs, buying equipment for teachers, and other civic works, which
inspire the local population and contribute to creating a higher level replacement for when the character dies.

Note that although players can roll up a second character, while the first is busy training for example, the experience
available from these funds can only be used in the event of a permanent death of the character who spent these funds.
The current character receives no experience for spending the funds in this way; it is the replacement character that
benefits.

A player may have her character name an heir to inherit all her wealth and possessions. The process causes a loss of 10%
of the wealth to hire barristers, money-changers, and government scribes and signatories. This heir must always be a
newly rolled-up first level character. At this point the original character retires from adventuring and becomes an NPC.
