# Treasure and Transport

In Knave, the primary way characters gain XP is by bringing treasure back to a safe haven. The value of returned
treasure in coin is divided evenly among the players on the expedition as XP. Converting the treasure returned this way
into useful wealth is a separate matter. Magic items do not count towards XP - their utility is its own reward.

## Slots and Coins

Storage in Knave is measured in **slots**, value in **coins (ƒ)**, which are equivalent of gold coins. Each player
character has 10 + CON slots. 500 gold coins fit in one slot. Here are some values for 'how many things fit into a slot'

| Item Type | /slot | ƒ value of a full slot |
|-----------|------:|-----------------------:|
| Copper Coins | 12,500 | 125 |
| Silver Coins | 2,500 | 250 |
| Gold Coins | 500 | 500 |
| Gems | 500 | variable |
| Rations | 3 | 30 (at typical prices) |
| Small jewelry (rings, bracelets, necklaces without large pendants, no headwear) | 5 | variable |
| Small vials (not potions) | 5 | variable |

## Traveling with treasure

Some treasures (typically but not exclusively jewelry) derive their value from fine workmanship. When traveling
overland, if these treasures are not carefully handled they can be tarnished or damaged, losing some or potentially all
of their value.
